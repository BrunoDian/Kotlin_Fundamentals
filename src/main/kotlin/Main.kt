/* What is Kotlin?
 * It's a modern programming language, used for:
 * Web development;
 * Server side applications;
 * Data Science;
 * Declared by Google as the main development language for Android;
 * And now it's in Beta for Multiplatform Mobile, when you share the logic of your iOS and Android apps.
 *
 * How can Kotlin do all this? Because of JDK and JVM.
 * The Kotlin code that you write is compiled by the JDK (Java Development Kit) to another code called
 * 'Java bytecode' and it's an intermediate of high level code and a machine code.
 * This 'Java bytecode' is read by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and converted to a Machine Code, adding
 * instructions about the processor and system operational.
 * This means that every system that has a JVM can read Kotlin code!
